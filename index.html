                            This paper presents a new algorithm to identify Bengali Sign Language (BdSL) for recognizing 46 hand gestures, including 9 gestures for 11 vowels, 28 gestures for 39 consonants and 9 gestures for 9 numerals according to the similarity of pronunciation. The positions of the fingertips were found by applying a fingertip finder algorithm. Eleven features were extracted from each image to train a multilayered feed-forward neural network with a back - propagation training algorithm. A database of 2300 images of Bengali signs was constructed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, where 70%, 15% and 15% images were used for training, testing, and validating, respectively. Experimental result showed an average of 88.69% accuracy in recognizing BdSL which is very much promising compare to other existing methods.
